Non-interactive mode is only meant for scripted use on test networks or known
safe environments.

Make sure you remember the password you gave when creating a new account (with
either new or import). Without it you are not able to unlock your account.

Note that exporting your key in unencrypted format is NOT supported.

It is safe to transfer the entire directory or the individual keys therein
between ethereum nodes by simply copying.

Make sure you backup your keys regularly.`,
